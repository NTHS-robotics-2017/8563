Glyph Arm:
    Must be able to securely grip glyphs, slide them into the cryptobox and release
        without knocking any glyphs out of the cryptobox.
    Must be able to raise glyps to top of cryptobox without disturbing lower levels
        of glyphs.

Relic Arm:
    Linear slide must be able to extend 32" from mounting point of robot. (Claw will
        add a couple of inches.)
    Claw must be capable of rotating upwards with relic in order to clear arena wall.
    Claw must grab relic from down-most rotated position.
    Claw must grab relic with enough force to keep the relic still relative to the 
        claw mechanism. This is so that when the claw rotates fully back down after 
        clearing the arena wall, the relic is already in the upright position and 
        will remain standing when the claw releases the relic.

Drivetrain:
    Robot must be able to drive onto the balance board without requiring a specific
        driving technique.
